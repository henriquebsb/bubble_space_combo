# Game Audio Files

This folder contains audio files for the Math Bubble Game.

## Supported Audio Formats
- MP3 (.mp3)
- OGG (.ogg) 
- WAV (.wav)

## Audio Files to Add

### Initial Music (Plays on Website Load)
Place your initial music file in this folder with one of these names:
- `initial-music.mp3`
- `initial-music.ogg`
- `initial-music.wav`

This music plays when the website loads for the first time (on first user interaction), before transitioning to background music.

### Background Music (Plays After Initial Music)
Place your background music file in this folder with one of these names:
- `background-music.mp3`
- `background-music.ogg`
- `background-music.wav`

The game will automatically try to load these files in order. If no audio files are found, the game will use a fallback ambient sound generated by the Web Audio API.

## Audio Features

### Initial Music
- Plays when the website first loads (on first user interaction)
- Fades in smoothly over 1 second
- Stops when user clicks "Start Game" and transitions to background music
- Volume set to 30% by default
- Starts on any user interaction (click, keypress, touch)

### Background Music
- Loops continuously
- Fades in when started
- Volume set to 30% by default
- Starts when clicking "Start Game" button (replaces initial music)

### Sound Effects
The game includes built-in sound effects using Web Audio API:
- **Correct Answer**: Ascending musical notes (A4, C#5, E5)
- **Wrong Answer**: Descending sawtooth wave
- **Bubble Pop**: Quick descending sine wave
- **Ambient Sound**: Gentle sine wave melody (fallback when no audio files)

## How It Works

1. When the game loads, it tries to load `initial-music.mp3` first
2. When user first interacts with the page (click, keypress, touch), initial music starts playing
3. When user clicks "Start Game", initial music fades out and background music starts
4. If no initial music is found, it tries to load background music directly
5. If no audio files are found, the game creates ambient sounds using Web Audio API
6. Sound effects are generated programmatically for immediate feedback
7. Initial music starts on any user interaction, background music starts on "Start Game"

## Adding Your Own Audio

### For Initial Music
1. Place your initial music file in this folder
2. Name it `initial-music.mp3` (or .ogg/.wav)
3. This will play when the website loads (on first user interaction)

### For Background Music
1. Place your background music file in this folder
2. Name it `background-music.mp3` (or .ogg/.wav)
3. This will loop continuously after clicking "Start Game"

### Audio Flow
```
Website Loads → User Interaction → Initial Music → Click "Start Game" → Background Music (loops)
```

## Browser Compatibility

The audio system works in all modern browsers and includes fallbacks for older browsers. The Web Audio API ensures sound effects work even without audio files.
